This repo contains the code for the project of the course.

For this project we got a set of files about wearable sensors and we have done some manipulation on those data with R. The R code does the following:

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

There are plenty of information about each step on R comments. The list of variables and its units of the last extracted dataset is available in the codebook.md file.
